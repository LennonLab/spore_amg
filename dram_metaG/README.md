# dram_metaG

Using list of sporulation genes, we have used DRAM to search for homologs in MAGs (Metagenome assemble genomes), aka UViG (Uncultivated Virus Genome).

** Datasets

1. CSU
2. GPD (with host prediction data)
3. GVD (with host prediction data)

** DRAM output files

** What was done
 *** Assign sporulator status to host of GPD and GVD
 *** Test enrichment of sporulation genes in GVD and GPD
 *** Finalize list of enriched sporulation genes.
 *** map enriched genes to host phyla
