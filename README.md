# spore_amg
Sporulation genes in viromes

To satisfy cross dependencies should be run in this order:

1. **spor_gene_list** - compiling a list of sporulation genes. 

2. **gtdb_spor** - Taxonomy based classification of sporulators. 

3. **enrichment** - Proof of concept enrichment test using viral RefSeq.

4. **dram_metaG** - Analysis of DRAM output. Sporulation genes in gut and other metagenomes.

5. **genes_of_interest** - Sequence analysis of specific AMGs.
