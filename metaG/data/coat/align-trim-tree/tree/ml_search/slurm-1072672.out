RAxML-NG was called at 02-Feb-2022 09:40:54 as follows:

raxml-ng --msa /N/u/danschw/Carbonate/GitHub/spore_amg/metaG/data/coat/align-trim-tree/check_msa/parse-msa.raxml.rba --model LG+G4+F --prefix /N/u/danschw/Carbonate/GitHub/spore_amg/metaG/data/coat/align-trim-tree/tree/ml_search/rand-103 --threads 2 --seed 103 --tree pars{10}

Analysis options:
  run mode: ML tree search
  start tree(s): parsimony (10)
  random seed: 103
  tip-inner: OFF
  pattern compression: ON
  per-rate scalers: OFF
  site repeats: ON
  fast spr radius: AUTO
  spr subtree cutoff: 1.000000
  branch lengths: proportional (ML estimate, algorithm: NR-FAST)
  SIMD kernels: AVX2
  parallelization: PTHREADS (2 threads), thread pinning: OFF

WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (LG+G4+F) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.
